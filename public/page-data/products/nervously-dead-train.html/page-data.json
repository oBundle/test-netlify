And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them. The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were told. So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could. When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to think what she should do next. She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to act. There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given.</br></br><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=5886744836\">Image Source: www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=5886744836</a>","weight":8.33,"images":[{"url_standard":"https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-zncidpxh/products/17376/images/42/8503452992_5bd2c82b11__58899.1553985716.500.750.jpg?c=2","url_thumbnail":"https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-zncidpxh/products/17376/images/42/8503452992_5bd2c82b11__58899.1553985716.190.285.jpg?c=2"}],"variants":[{"product_id":17376,"id":185705,"sku":"8YKDP"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"productId":"8022f49c-d0a9-5bb7-883a-dee939661d31"}}}
